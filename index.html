					<h2>Background</h2>
					<h3>Formed from the confluence of five estuaries: the rivers Kent, Keer, Leven, Lune and Wyre, Morecambe Bay is the largest continuous area of tidal mudflats in the UK. The tidal flats are supported by extensive salt marshes, making up 5% of the UK total</h3>
					<footer>Fabian Cousteau, The World's Last Wilderness Revealed</footer>
				</section>

				<section data-background="./images/P1020353.JPG">
					<h3>The mudflats support a rich and diverse range of invertebrates, shorebirds, fish. The salt marshes support grazing animals, and a number of rare plant species</h3>
					<footer>Fabian Cousteau, The World's Last Wilderness Revealed</footer>
				</section>

				<section data-background="./images/Cross-Bay-Walk.jpg">
					<h3 >The Bay is a complex and fragile ecosystem, with internationally important assemblages of wildlife. However, it must also support industries for the 200,000 people that live and work in the area, and these all have an impact.</h3>
					<footer >http://www.ukmarinesac.org.uk/</footer>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Impacts on the Bay</h2>
					<h3 class="fragment">Litter, from tourism</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment">Water Quality, from agriculture</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment">Climate Change, from human activity in general</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment">Polltion, from industry</h3>
				</section>


				<section data-background="./images/rubbish01.jpg">	
				<h2>Litter</h2>
				<h3>The primary sources of litter in the Bay are tourists/visitors, industry (fishing), and plastic waste from households.</h3>
				<h3 class="fragment">The amount and type of litter varies throughout the year, and is dependent on the recent local weather.</h3>
				<footer class="fragment">Marine Conservation Society</footer>
				</section>

				<section>	
				<h3>Marine litter is a known hazard to wildlife and human health.</h3>
				<h3 class="fragment">Many common types of litter stay in the environment for decades, if not longer.</h3>

				<footer class="fragment">Marine Conservation Society</footer>
				</section>	

				<section data-background="./images/december.JPG">
				<h3 >The MCS reported in 2014 that the North-West beaches have less than 2500 items of litter per square km, and a reduction of 70% over previous years</h3>
				<h3  class="fragment">Combining data from multiple volunteer groups suggests approximately 40 tonnes of litter have been picked up around the Bay by volunteers since 2003</h3>
				<footer  class="fragment">Morecambe Bay Partnership and Marine Conservation Society</footer>
				</section>			

				<section data-background="./images/drainage_channel.jpg">
				<h2 >Water Quality</h2>
				<h3   class="fragment">Water quality in the Bay is affected by agricultural and land management practices in the catchments of the rivers that flow into the bay.</h3>
				<footer  class="fragment">Source to Sea</footer>
				</section>

				<section data-background="./images/digger.jpg">
				<h3 >Sediment and fertiliser run-off affect water quality and nutrient content, whilst moorland drainage and watercourse alterations affect and obstruct water flow</h3>
				<footer >Source to Sea</footer>
				</section>	

				<section data-background="./images/fish.jpg">
				<h3 >These affect the nutrient levels in bay, and reduce wildlife mobility and habitats.</h3>
				<footer >Source to Sea</footer>
				</section>			

				<section data-background="./images/saltmarsh.jpg">
				<h2>Climate Change</h2>
				<h3 class="fragment">The Bay contains many habitats considered vulnerable to climate change.</h3>
				<h3 class="fragment">The saltmarsh, saline lagoons and cliff areas are at highest risk, whereas the estuarine and intertidal mud flats are considered a lower risk.</h3>
				<footer class="fragment">Source to Sea</footer>
				</section>

				<section data-background="./images/storm.jpg">
				<h3 >Sea-level change and increased storm surges are likely to significantly reshape the coastline.</h3>
				<h3 class="fragment" >Changing rainfall patterns and intensity will affect fluvial and estuarine processes</h3>
				<h3 class="fragment" >The need to protect human assets will put increased pressure on natural habitats</h3>

				<section data-background="./images/Centrica.jpg">
				<h2>Industry: Gas</h2>
				<h3 class="fragment">The Morecambe Bay gas field is the second largest in the UK. At it's peak it produced 15% of Britain's gas supply, but production has declined.</h3>
				<h3 class="fragment">The gas fields were discovered in the 70's and the first gas was extracted in 1985.</h3>
				</section>

				<section  data-background="./images/Centrica2.jpg">
				<h3 >Levels of hydrocarbons and metals in the water and surface sediments have been compared to their levels before the gas field was developed.</h3>
				<h3 >There are high levels of contamination throughout the bay and wider area, initially thought to be related to gas extraction, but current research suggests over 80% derives from riverine input.</h3>
				<footer >Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science 2005</footer>
				</section>

				<section data-background="./images/sellafield-feat.png">
				<h2 >Industry: Nuclear</h2>
				<h3 >Radioactive waste has been discharged into the Irish Sea from Sellafield since 1952, with a peak in the 1970s and a general decline since then. </h3>
				<h3  class="fragment">The muddy sediments in the bay act as a sink for elements such as Plutonium and Caesium, due to sediment activity and dispersal</h3>
				<footer  class="fragment">Greenpeace, 2014</footer>
				</section>

				<section data-background="./images/sellafield.jpg">
				<h3>Greenpeace describes the Irish Sea as the most radioactively contaminated sea in the world, with approximately 8 million litres of nuclear waste being discharged into it every day.</h3>

					<h2>Finally, what's in a name?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The name "Morecambe Bay" can be traced back to the Greek Astronomer Ptolemy</h3>
					<img class="center" src="./images/ptolemy.gif" alt="Ptolemy"> 
				</section>

				<section  data-background="./images/Ptolemy_Map.jpg">
					<h3>He noted a place called Morikambe eischusis somewhere on the west coast between the Ribble and the Solway.</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>It took until the 18th century for the name to be more commonly adopted, and even then there was still some uncertainty as to what the name actually means- tidal flats, crooked sea, curved coast, or just the Bay! </h3>
